# Graph Theory in Lean

## About me

Hi, I'm Alena and I'm a masters student at the University of Waterloo, should be wrapping that up
by next year and starting on my PhD. I've worked with Lean since the summer of 2020 when I 
graduated from the University of Delaware and joined in on Xena Project online with everything 
having moved online due to COVID. I mostly formalize topics in the realm of graph theory, 
combinatorics, and matroid theory. 

## About the project

In this project, we'll work with graph theory in Lean. I'll provide an introduction to how
we have defined a bunch of different topics and offer some lemmas for you to fill in the
proofs of, although if you have other ideas about what you want to formalize feel free
to let me know your suggestions and we can work on that!
